## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
Lab 3, part 1
Lab 3 was my first favorite lab because we got to learn how to calculate a person's basal metabolic rate. Using formulas given to us we practiced writing out functions. The functions would take a person's weight, height, and age and output the person's BMR. I find this useful because I enjoy going to the gym.

Lab 4, part 2
My second favorite lab was Lab 4, especially the guessing game. I particularly like the guessing game because this was the first we were using if-statements in our code. We would have one player enter a secret number while the other person would have to guess the number. We used if-statements to determine if the second player's guess was right or wrong.

Lab 8, part 2
My last favorite lab was Lab 8. I really enjoyed doing lab 8 part 2 because it was the first lab where we used our code to create something more visual. In part 2 we used a inner and two outer loops to create a pattern
